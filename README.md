Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pod-request-access-landing-page-eyTmdkLSG" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
I had so much fun with this one! I thought the design had some interesting things such as the pattern on tablet and desktop, as well as how the input/button are designed for tablet and desktop. I hadn't done CSS patterns yet and thought that this would be a perfect occasion to learn how to do that!

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Sass/SCSS
- BEM
- JavaScript

# Looking Back
- I ended up making this responsive all the way down to about 200px wide with an in-between mobile/tablet, and an in-between tablet/desktop. I changed the layout for the images on the mobile design because I thought they were far too small to read, the way they are in the design. I did a 2x2 grid so they had more room to fill instead of a single row with 4 columns.
- I added a couple functions to my JS beyond the email verification, so that the layout looks the exact same when the error messages are showing, and that the text entered in the email field as well as the error messages persist when the layout changes. So you can enter an email and submit on the mobile design, then resize the window to the tablet/desktop layout and what you've typed, and the message will still be there. Quite happy with the result - It's not pixel perfect but I learned some new things, and I think that's much more important!
- I could've definitely shortened my JS a bit by putting repeated lines in functions.
